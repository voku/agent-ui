# Agent Loop Dream

**Trigger Anchor:** Periodic guidance maintenance is due (after several close-outs, after a package bump, or the user says "dream") -> run the read-only review, triage it, and hand each decision to a named human. Dream never approves, applies, retires, deletes, or rewrites guidance.

Dream is the maintenance step of the Promotion Loop (`Dream -> Proposal -> Human Approval -> Constraint/Skill -> Enforcement -> Retirement`). Capturing findings and closing a Run stay in `agent-loop-learning-boundary`; changing a skill, doc, or memory file stays with the owner of that file.

## Automatic preview

The SessionStart hook runs the read-only preview itself when it is due (no previous automatic run, the Learning inputs changed by content, or the last run is older than seven days) and shows the numbers under `## Agent Loop Dream`. Treat that section as a finished Review step only when the preview succeeded: report its numbers, and do not rerun Dream just to see them. The section carries no outcome coverage, and on a failure ("the automatic Dream preview failed") it carries no numbers at all; in either case run the manual Review below to get what is missing. It is an observation, never a decision, and it writes nothing into the Learning root. Everything below still applies to candidates, triage and human handoff. `AGENT_LOOP_DREAM_AUTORUN=0` switches the automatic preview off.

## Run

1. **Precondition:** `vendor/bin/agent-loop learn validate` passes and the Learning root has no half-written concurrent work (`git status` on the root). A failing validate is invalid local data or a package defect: read the failing package source path to decide, and never weaken local data to get green.
2. **Review (read-only):** `make agent_learning_dream` when the host includes `resources/make/agent-loop.mk`, otherwise `vendor/bin/agent-loop learn dream --report .agent-loop/dream/latest.json --dry-run`. Add `--format=json` (`ARGS=--format=json`) for machine-readable output. The Make target reads `AGENT_LEARNING_ROOT` and `AGENT_DREAM_REPORT`; an empty root means auto-discovery.
3. **Report the numbers verbatim:** evaluated guidance, warnings, review decisions, suppressed unchanged decisions, outcome coverage. Only suppressed decisions is a healthy no-op, not proof that guidance is good.

Flag semantics (from the Learning CLI): candidates are written only with `--write-candidates` and never together with `--dry-run` (`--dry-run` wins); `--report PATH` writes the deterministic JSON report; a bare `learn dream` renders the review and writes neither. Embedding hosts call `WorkflowDreamService` (`preview()` writes nothing, `writeCandidates()` writes candidate Proposals only) with the same contract.

## Triage

| Signal | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `evidence_reference_unresolvable` | Repair the path, or turn a reference that is genuinely outside this repository into `manual_verification` keeping the claim in its summary. Never delete the observation. |
| `outcome_unknown` | Append-only history; do not rewrite it. Reduce recurrence at Recall close-out instead. |
| Review decisions > 0 | Candidates, not decisions. Present each with its provenance and the guidance it targets. |
| `CONFLICT` / `REPLACEMENT_CANDIDATE` | Only explicit lineage or exact duplicate wording produces these; different prose is never guessed to conflict. A conflict record uses `NO_DURABLE_LEARNING`, so a human can acknowledge or reject it without a mutation. |

## Review the pending queue

Dream also owes a view of proposals that are already waiting (candidate or approved), not only newly written candidates. Use `learn proposal-queue --probe <repo guidance file>` (repeat `--probe` per guidance file the repository keeps, for example its memory index; add `--format=json` for machine output). It is read-only and states facts only: allowed transitions, lineage (`corrects`, `corrected_by`, `supersedes`), other proposals on the same target, unresolved paths, and how much of the proposed wording already exists in the target or probe files.

Present one table row per proposal: `id | status action | target | signals | take | reason`.

- The **take** is yours: approve, reject, acknowledge or apply, with a one-line reason. It is advice for a named human, never a decision, and the tool does not produce it.
- Ground every take in a signal. "Already covered" needs an exact or high wording match in a repository file; a memory of the guidance elsewhere is not evidence. "Superseded" needs `corrects` or `corrected_by`. Without a signal, label the take unverified.
- An approved proposal whose wording is already exact in its target was applied by hand: confirm, then record it with `proposal-mark-applied` instead of writing the guidance again.
- Run a transition only after the human names the decision, with `--by` and, for reject and acknowledge, a real reason. One proposal per decision; never batch to empty the queue.

## Triage the finding backlog

A Learning backlog that nobody works grows until the hint is ignored. Work it in the same pass as the proposal queue.

1. `learn finding-reconcile --dry-run`, then with `--by` once the human agrees: it consolidates validated findings whose proposals all reached a terminal decision. Proposal transitions do this themselves now, so a non-empty list means a root decided by an older package. Do this first; it shrinks the backlog without any judgement.
2. `learn finding-queue --probe <repo guidance file>` lists what is really open. It is read-only and states facts only: proposals citing the finding, unresolved scope paths, how much of the conclusion already exists in the probe files, the transitions the lifecycle accepts.
3. Present one table per bucket with a take and a reason per row, each take grounded in a signal or an inspected repository fact. The buckets are advice, not a taxonomy the tool enforces:
   - **resolved in code or tooling**: archive, naming the file that now carries the fix;
   - **rule candidate**: a defect with a syntactic shape that a PHPStan rule, phpcs sniff or meta-test can detect; say which engine and the false-positive risk;
   - **guidance line**: name the owning skill, ADR or memory row, and batch rows with one owner into one proposal;
   - **no durable learning**: taste, one-off or environment-specific facts, archived with a real reason.
4. Low wording overlap does not prove a lesson is missing: findings are written as observations and guidance as rules. Before a take says "not covered" or "already covered", look for the key identifiers in the repository and label the take unverified when you did not.
5. Nothing changes until the human names the decision. Then run the transition (`finding-transition`, or a proposal through the existing approve, reject and acknowledge path) with `--by` and a real reason. `finding-transition <id> <status> --by ACTOR --reason TEXT` stores the reason on the finding with who and when; give one for every archive or supersede, because otherwise the record cannot say why a finding left the backlog.

## Review the guidance for contradictions

Written guidance (AGENTS.md, MEMORY.md, skills, ADRs) drifts apart because each file is edited alone. While a pass has just read several of them, look for instructions that contradict each other, then let the human decide on one shared table.

1. `learn guidance-consistency --source <glob>... --format markdown` (needs `voku/agent-learning` 0.18.32+) lists facts only: a path a file names that does not exist, and wording repeated in two files. These rows are candidates, not contradictions.
2. Search by topic for what the tool cannot see: the same command, location or owner stated differently (for example which Make target runs a check, where a rule lives, who may commit), a rule that the example next to it breaks, a rule that the code no longer follows. Quote both sides with file and line; a contradiction you cannot quote on both sides is not a row.
3. Present ONE table in the user's language: `# | Aussage A | Aussage B | Befund | Vorschlag | Urteil`, leaving `Urteil` empty for the human. Each Vorschlag names the surviving wording and the single owning file; duplicates are resolved by pointing to one home, not by editing both copies. Say that coverage is sampled, not exhaustive.
4. Nothing changes until the human gives a verdict per row. Apply approved rows under a governed task (docs and skills directly, memory rows through their proposal); record a finding only when it changes project code, docs or skills, never one about this process.

## Write candidates (only on an explicit human ask)

`make agent_learning_dream_write_candidates` (or `learn dream --write-candidates`) writes review records only. Run it once step 1 shows no concurrent diff in the Learning root. Route each record through exactly one of `learn proposal-approve`, `learn proposal-reject` or `learn proposal-acknowledge`, with a named human (`--by`) and, for reject and acknowledge, a real reason. Never approve a candidate because it exists, and never bulk-acknowledge to empty the queue.

## History projections

`learn history-status` is read-only. Before `learn history-rebuild`, inspect the result with `--dry-run`; rebuild once and only when the source history is stable, not inside a dirty shared root. Projections never replace the immutable evidence.

## Close-out

Report compactly: the command run, the report path, the verbatim counts, which warnings were repaired versus left, and which decisions still need a human. Say plainly when candidates were not written or projections were not rebuilt. The report is regenerable working state; do not commit it.
