# Agent Hard Constraint Author

Use this skill when repeated learning should become an executable check. The point is to move stable behavior from prose into a rule that can fail validation.

## Fast Path

1. Start from validated findings. Require several independent findings or one clearly documented critical incident.
2. Define the objective violation, scope, allowed boundaries, detectability, false-positive risk, validation commands, target rule path, registration files, and example rule paths.
3. Export the constraint package before changing enforcement:

```bash
vendor/bin/agent-learning constraint-export \
  --root infra/doc/agent-learning \
  --proposal proposal.2026-06-15.001
```

4. Inspect `specification.json#mode` and `examples.json`:
   - `generate`: inspect `examples.json` before coding. Use the examples as structural precedent (rule/fixer interface, error identifiers, configuration), semantic-neighbor precedent (similar AST nodes, token traversal, type checks), and validation precedent (fixture structure). Implement the rule in the consuming project, not in this package, unless the rule is package-generic. Include valid, invalid, boundary, and false-positive fixtures where the engine supports fixtures, then register the rule in the consuming project's analyzer configuration.
   - `adopt_existing`: the configured target rule and registration files already exist. Do **not** generate duplicate enforcement or synthetic fixtures merely to satisfy the promotion path. Validate the existing enforcement against the approved constraint semantics and historical bad/good states using the exported validation commands.
5. Validate both directions appropriate to the selected mode. For generated rules, the invalid fixture must fail with the intended rule identifier and the valid fixture plus real target files must pass. For adopted enforcement, prove the historical bad state is rejected and a valid good state remains accepted by the existing target.
6. Record validation evidence and content hashes before marking the proposal applied.
7. Activate the manifest only after implementation/adoption and validation:

```bash
vendor/bin/agent-learning constraint-loop \
  --root infra/doc/agent-learning \
  proposal.2026-06-15.001 \
  --by agent \
  --commit working-tree \
  --validation infra/doc/agent-learning/validation-results/proposal.2026-06-15.001.json
```

## Quality Bar

- Prefer PHPStan or PHP-CS-Fixer when the violation is statically detectable.
- Consider dynamic return type extensions (`DynamicFunctionReturnTypeExtension`, `DynamicMethodReturnTypeExtension`) when recurring findings stem from imprecise helper or mapper return types rather than forbidden AST nodes. Teaching the analyzer how a helper behaves solves root causes and prevents unsafe inline casts across the codebase.
- Preserve intentional strict contracts (`literal-string`, `class-string<T>`, `non-empty-string`); do not weaken contracts to bypass proof gaps.
- Keep rule identifiers stable and engine-valid (e.g. `RuleErrorBuilder::identifier()` in PHPStan or fixer name in PHP-CS-Fixer).
- Inspect `examples.json` as few-shot precedent for AST node selection, scope handling, and false-positive avoidance, but preserve the approved `ConstraintSpecification` as authoritative over example behavior. Examples demonstrate implementation patterns, not requirements.
- Fixtures must prove that candidate divergence from examples is intentional and properly bounded.
- Make selection scope explicit; recall uses scope overlap, not semantic similarity.
- Do not activate generated or adopted constraints silently.
- Do not accept `adopt_existing`, file existence, or exit code alone as proof; inspect the existing enforcement and its historical bad/good behavior.
